### 1.WHAT IS AN IP (Intellectual Property)?
An intellectual property is an abstract idea or concept created by someone which is used in commercial areas by its owners.
Ideas under an IP will be protected by law, allowing its owners to use them freely in any way or form.
There are several ways of protecting Intellectual property, and they will change depending on what wants to be protected.

IPs can be protected by using one, some or every type of law. For example a videogame would be protected with Copyright with it's Soundtrack, trademarks protecting any sort of sign that is easily related to the videogame itself (e.g Pokeball from Pokemon)

#### 1.1 Copyright 
Copyright is a law that allows the authors of certain works such as (books, songs, images, movies or websites) to have full control on who is allowed to copy the owned work. The owner will give permission to someone else (ussually paying, and under certain rules applied by the owner) to copy the work and do whatever they want with given permission.
Although copyright has no specific expiring date, it will ussualy be removed between 50 and 100 years after the death of the original author, ownership beeing held by the current owner until that date.

Songs are always seen followed by copyright so that the protected song can't be used without the permission of the author, for example on Youtube many copyright infringements are made from using certain songs without permission.

If someone without permission wanted to use a copyrighted work, by modifying the base work enough it would be able to bypass copyright. For example by fastforwarding music or mixing two songs to distort them.

#### 1.2 Trade Secrets
Trade secrets are a form of Intellectual property protection ussually used by manufacturing companies of commercial products. They comprise formulas,practices,processes,designs or any information about a commercial product that have economic value because they are ussualy secret from foreign people related to the product.

Alimentary products such as drinks or products with ingredients that can't be found easily are ussualy protected by trade secret laws. They protect the formula which forms that specific product.  

#### 1.3 Trademarks
Trademarks are a sort of protection for IPs, these sort of law is used for all sorts of signs, images or symbols that represent a certain procuct. Trademarks can protect many things, some examples would be (Icons such as a Pokeball and Pokemon, Letters such as an R with a star from Rockstar, brand names such as Apple, Logos like  the one from Ubisoft, stylized fonts from Coca-Cola and of course any fictional character such as Mario from Nintendo, Sonic from Sega, etc.)

#### 1.4 Patents
Finally patents are another type of protection for Intellectual property in which it gives its owner the legal right to exclude others from making, using, selling and importing an invention for a limited period of years, in exchange for publishing an enabling public disclosure of the invention.

### 2. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN  VIDEOGAMES

In videogames, protecting their intellectual property is one of the first things companies do when developing a game. This is due to the fact that videogames as a whole have many different parts to be protected from unauthorised use from people that are not allowed to.

But IPs are more than protection laws for companies, they are also the lifeblood of the industry. IP rights are associated both with the tools used to develop games and the content included in a game. For example, copyright safeguards the creative and artistic expression that goes into the software (the code), the artwork and the sound (and music) of a game.

Trademarks protect the names and logos associated with a game and its characters and can be used to set a company and its games apart from others in the minds of consumers; patents protect the next generation hardware (and are particularly important for hardware manufacturers) or technical solutions as well as the inventive gameplay or design elements; and trade secrets can be used to protect a companyâ€™s competitive advantage by protecting confidential business information, such as contacts or subscriber mailing list data, or an in-house development tool such as game engines, modeling tools, etc.

Without the appropriate rights and licensing agreements in place, developers may find their game cannot be distributed; they may be unable to fully leverage the value of their work. What developers own is IP; what they sell (through licensing deals) is IP. In fact, all they have is IP, so they need to protect it.
