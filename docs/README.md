### 1.WHAT IS AN IP (Intellectual Property)?
An intellectual property is an abstract idea or concept created by someone which is used in commercial areas by its owners.
Ideas under an IP will be protected by law, allowing its owners to use them freely in any way or form.
There are several ways of protecting Intellectual property, and they will change depending on what wants to be protected.

#### 1.1 Copyright 
Copyright is a law that allows the owners of certain works such as (books, songs, images, movies or websites) to have full control on who is allowed to copy the owned work. Although authors ussually recieve the copyright ownership, the copyright ownership can be sold. The owner will give permission to someone else (ussually paying, and under certain rules applied by the owner) to copy the work and do whatever they want with given permission.
Although copyright has no specific expiring date, it will ussualy be removed between 50 and 100 years after the death of the original author, ownership beeing held by the current owner until that date.
