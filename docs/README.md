### 1.WHAT IS AN IP (Intellectual Property)?
An intellectual property is an abstract idea or concept created by someone which is used in commercial areas by its owners.
Ideas under an IP will be protected by law, allowing its owners to use them freely in any way or form.
There are several ways of protecting Intellectual property, and they will change depending on what wants to be protected.

#### 1.1 Copyright 
Copyright is a law that allows the authors of certain works such as (books, songs, images, movies or websites) to have full control on who is allowed to copy the owned work. The owner will give permission to someone else (ussually paying, and under certain rules applied by the owner) to copy the work and do whatever they want with given permission.
Although copyright has no specific expiring date, it will ussualy be removed between 50 and 100 years after the death of the original author, ownership beeing held by the current owner until that date.

Songs are always seen followed by copyright so that the protected song can't be used without the permission of the author, for example on Youtube many copyright infringements are made from using certain songs without permission.

If someone without permission wanted to use a copyrighted work, by modifying the base work enough it would be able to bypass copyright. For example by fastforwarding music or mixing two songs to distort them.

#### 1.2 Trade Secrets
Trade secrets are a form of Intellectual property protection ussually used by manufacturing companies of commercial products. They comprise formulas,practices,processes,designs or any information about a commercial product that have economic value because they are ussualy secret from foreign people related to the product.

Alimentary products such as drinks or products with ingredients that can't be found easily are ussualy protected by trade secret laws. They protect the formula which forms that specific product.
