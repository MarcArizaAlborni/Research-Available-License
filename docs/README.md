### 1.WHAT IS AN IP (Intellectual Property)?
An intellectual property is an abstract idea or concept created by someone which is used in commercial areas by its owners.
Ideas under an IP will be protected by law, allowing its owners to use them freely in any way or form.
There are several ways of protecting Intellectual property, and they will change depending on what wants to be protected.

IPs can be protected by using one, some or every type of law. For example a videogame would be protected with Copyright with it's Soundtrack, trademarks protecting any sort of sign that is easily related to the videogame itself (e.g Pokeball from Pokemon)

#### 1.1 Copyright 
Copyright is a law that allows the authors of certain works such as (books, songs, images, movies or websites) to have full control on who is allowed to copy the owned work. The owner will give permission to someone else (ussually paying, and under certain rules applied by the owner) to copy the work and do whatever they want with given permission.
Although copyright has no specific expiring date, it will ussualy be removed between 50 and 100 years after the death of the original author, ownership beeing held by the current owner until that date.

Songs are always seen followed by copyright so that the protected song can't be used without the permission of the author, for example on Youtube many copyright infringements are made from using certain songs without permission.

If someone without permission wanted to use a copyrighted work, by modifying the base work enough it would be able to bypass copyright. For example by fastforwarding music or mixing two songs to distort them.

When a C leter is seen next to the name of a work, or somhwere related to that work, it means that it is protected by copyright.

#### 1.2 Trade Secrets
Trade secrets are a form of Intellectual property protection ussually used by manufacturing companies of commercial products. They comprise formulas,practices,processes,designs or any information about a commercial product that have economic value because they are ussualy secret from foreign people related to the product.

Alimentary products such as drinks or products with ingredients that can't be found easily are ussualy protected by trade secret laws. They protect the formula which forms that specific product.  

#### 1.3 Trademarks
Trademarks are a sort of protection for IPs, these sort of law is used for all sorts of signs, images or symbols that represent a certain procuct. Trademarks can protect many things, some examples would be (Icons such as a Pokeball and Pokemon, Letters such as an R with a star from Rockstar, brand names such as Apple, Logos like  the one from Ubisoft, stylized fonts from Coca-Cola and of course any fictional character such as Mario from Nintendo, Sonic from Sega, etc.)

When a TM sign is seen next to a logo, image or symbol it means theres a trademark applied to that work.

#### 1.4 Patents
Finally patents are another type of protection for Intellectual property in which it gives its owner the legal right to exclude others from making, using, selling and importing an invention for a limited period of years, in exchange for publishing an enabling public disclosure of the invention.






### 2. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN  VIDEOGAMES

In videogames, protecting their intellectual property is one of the first things companies do when developing a game. This is due to the fact that videogames as a whole have many different parts to be protected from unauthorised use from people that are not allowed to.

But IPs are more than protection laws for companies, they are also the lifeblood of the industry. IP rights are associated both with the tools used to develop games and the content included in a game. For example, copyright safeguards the creative and artistic expression that goes into the software (the code), the artwork and the sound (and music) of a game.

Trademarks protect the names and logos associated with a game and its characters and can be used to set a company and its games apart from others in the minds of consumers; patents protect the next generation hardware (and are particularly important for hardware manufacturers) or technical solutions as well as the inventive gameplay or design elements; and trade secrets can be used to protect a companyâ€™s competitive advantage by protecting confidential business information, such as contacts or subscriber mailing list data, or an in-house development tool such as game engines, modeling tools, etc.

Without the appropriate rights and licensing agreements in place, developers may find their game cannot be distributed; they may be unable to fully leverage the value of their work. What developers own is IP; what they sell (through licensing deals) is IP. In fact, all they have is IP, so they need to protect it.


Type of IP | Copyright | Trademark|Trade Secret|Patent
--- | --- | ---|-----|----|
**Time Span** |Around 100 years | For Ever|For Ever|20 years|
**Cost** | Cheap | Average|Average|Expensive|
**Obtain IP** | Easy |Medium|Medium|Hard|
**Usefulnes** | Mandatory | Mandatory|Recommended|Not necessary|
**Use in Videogames** | Often | Often|Often|Rarely|




### 3.LICENSING IPs

When developing a game, license owners should carefully examine each type of license and see which one fulfills their necessities.

Some of the main necessities that developers should look for are:

- Who will own the license? The owner of the license will usually be the one that creates the license and owns the rights of the product itself
- Will the game use a free license, a paid one or an original one? This depends completly in what the owner wants to do with it, specially if it wants it to have comercial use. Take into acount that some assets or characteristics that are not owned by the licensee can force the final product to have a certain type of license.
- How much money is available for the licensee to spend on licensing the game. Will it increase total sales, or it won't have any sort of effect on the overall amount of sales when released? Licenses are expensive, they vary in price depending on which type of license the licensor wants to use, but some of the most used types of licenses are not cheap to get.
- Which is the scope of the license? National or world-wide? Where will the game be released? Licenses can also vary depending on which legal framework the license will be aplied in.  
- How much time it will take for the licensee to have the license ready? Will it be ready for release? Licensing an Ip isn't necessarily slow, but depending on the type of license, the legal framework and the moment the license was create may vary the time needed.
- What will the license protect? Images, specific artistic styles, gameplay, logos, names, characters, map layouts, etc. Anything that can be licensed should probably be licensed if theres any sort of comercial/public use.
- Does any part of the license conflict with any previous license if used? Some licenses may not be compatible with previous licenses so have that in mind when licensing an IP


### 4. FREE AVAILABLE LICENSES

#### OPTIONS
If a developer is looking for free available licenses that offer different alternatives depending on what he is looking for, here are some of them:

##### Characteristics 
- Linking: linking of the licensed code with code licensed under a different license (e.g. when the code is provided as a library)
- Distribution: distribution of the code to third parties
- Modification: modification of the code by a licensee
- Patent grant: protection of licensees from patent claims made by code contributors regarding their contribution, and protection of contributors from patent claims made by licensees
- Private use: whether modification to the code must be shared with the community or may be used privately (e.g. internal use by a corporation)
- Sublicensing: whether modified code may be licensed under a different license (for example a copyright) or must retain the same license under which it was provided
- TM grant: use of trademarks associated with the licensed code or its contributors by a licensee


License | Latest Version | Linking|Distribution|Modification|Patent Grant|Private use|Sublicensing|TM grant|
--- | --- | ---|-----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
**Academic Free License** | 3.0 | Allowed|Allowed|Allowed|Yes|Yes|Allowed|No|
**Apache License** | 2.0 | Allowed|Allowed|Allowed|Yes|Yes|Allowed|No|
**Creative Commons Zero**| 1.0 |Public Domain|Public Domain|Public Domain|No|Public Domain|Public Domain|No|
**MIT License** | 1.0 | Allowed|Allowed|Allowed|Manually |Yes|Allowed|Manually|
**European Union Public License**|1.2| Copyleft | Copyleft|Copyleft|Yes|Yes|Copyleft|No|


*Copyleft: The license forces software to have the same characteristics as the ones it originates from, so if someone uses a piece of software with this license, it will also have to have the same characteristics as the license from the original piece of software*. It also allowes the licensee to aply licenses that are more public than its original one, but never less. than it.


#### INTERNATIONALLY APROVED
When choosing a license the licensee should also take into account that not all licenses work worldwide, thats why its recommended to choose one that is approved by the majority of license organitzations


License |Aproved by FSF (Free Software Foundation)| Aproved by GPL(General Public License)| Aproved by OSI
--- | --- | ---|---|
**Academic Free License** |Yes |No|Yes|
**Apache License** |Yes | Yes|Yes|
**Creative Commons Zero** |Yes | Yes|No Info|
**MIT License** | Yes | Yes|Yes|
**European Union Public License** | Yes | Yes|Yes|

#### CREATIVE COMMONS

A Creative Commons (CC) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted "work". A CC license is used when an author wants to give other people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that they (the author) have created. CC provides an author flexibility (for example, they might choose to allow only non-commercial uses of a given work) and protects the people who use or redistribute an author's work from concerns of copyright infringement as long as they abide by the conditions that are specified in the license by which the author distributes the work.

The CC licenses all grant the "baseline rights", such as the right to distribute the copyrighted work worldwide, for non-commercial purposes and without modification.The details of each of these licenses depend on the version, and comprises a selection out of four conditions:

In this chart we can see possible combinations that can be made using  Creative Commons Licenses. Allowing the licensee to choose what can other people do with their work, and how much freedom they have.

### 5. GETTING AN ACTUAL LICENSE FOR YOUR VIDEOGAME

After all this information, it may seem like getting a license for a videogame is not easy. That's why in the end if someone wanted to get a license for their videogame for comercial use the best option would be to have enough money to pay for everything that is required when licensing and getting a good lawyer that knows the procedure of licensing, specially depending in which legal framework & characteristics  you want your license to have.
